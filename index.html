                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p1>
                        On January 25th, 1990; Chase Follett was born in the small, scenic town of Bryan, Ohio to
                        Jeff and
                        Debra Follett.
                        Raised in the small, sleepy town; Chase attended the city of Bryan schools. As a youth, he
                        played
                        many different
                        sports such as football, baseball, soccer and roller hockey; all helping him develop skills
                        that
                        would be
                        beneficial to him as he progressed through life. From high school, Chase attended Ohio
                        University
                        where he graduated
                        with a degree in Political Science and Philosophy. After college graduation, he moved to
                        Columbus,
                        Ohio from 2013-2017.
                        In Columbus, he worked with many local non-profit organizations to help teach water safety
                        to young
                        swimmers and trained
                        many young lifeguards on the importance of lifeguarding and water safety. In September of
                        2017, he
                        was offered a position
                        with another non-profit in Colorado and made the move to Lafayette, Colorado where he
                        currently
                        resides.
